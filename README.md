# Bank-Loan-Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project
## Project Overview:
The Bank Loan Analysis Project focuses on analyzing loan application data to evaluate lending performance, borrower behavior, and loan risk. The project helps financial institutions make data-driven decisions by tracking key loan metrics such as approvals, repayments, defaults, and overall portfolio health through interactive dashboards.
## Dataset Used:
Bank loan application dataset containing:
Loan details (loan amount, interest rate, term)
Customer demographics (employment length, income, home ownership)
Loan status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current)
Issue date, purpose, grade, and verification status
Data was cleaned and transformed to ensure accuracy and consistency before analysis.
## Objectives:
✔️ Analyze loan performance and repayment behavior

✔️ Track good loans vs bad loans

✔️ Identify trends based on time, geography, and loan purpose

✔️ Monitor risk factors contributing to loan defaults

✔️ Provide actionable insights to improve lending strategy

## Key Features & Insights:
✅ Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount & Amount Received

✅ Good Loan vs Bad Loan Analysis

✅ Loan trends by:

  - Month (MTD & MoM analysis)
  
  - Loan purpose
  
  - Employment length
  
  - Home ownership
  
  - State/region

✅ Identification of high-risk loan categories

✅ Clear visualization of default rates and recovery patterns

## 📈 Performance Improvements:
  - Improved visibility into loan portfolio health using KPI-driven dashboards
  
  - Enabled faster decision-making by reducing manual reporting
  
  - Helped identify high-default segments, improving risk assessment accuracy
  
  - Enhanced tracking of Month-to-Date (MTD) and Same Period Last Year (SPLY) metrics
  
  - Reduced data inconsistencies through structured data modeling

## 💡 Tools & Techniques Used:
  - Power BI – Interactive dashboards & visual storytelling
  
  - SQL – Data extraction, filtering, joins, aggregations
  
  - Excel – Initial data cleaning & validation
  
  - DAX – Calculated measures (MTD, MoM, Good/Bad Loan %)
